# Voronoi Diagram

![Voronoi Diagram Example](https://github.com/CorrelateVisuals/Touchdesigner_Tools/blob/main/Voronoi_Diagram/Voronoi_Diagram_Image.PNG?raw=true)

## Overview

A Voronoi diagram is a spatial partitioning of a plane into regions based on the distance to a set of predefined points. Each region consists of all points closer to a specific input point than any other point in the set, forming a unique and convex polygon for each input point.

## Features

- Generate Voronoi diagrams in real-time
- Customizable input points
- Dynamic visualization of spatial partitioning
- Useful for various applications including:
  - Spatial analysis
  - Procedural generation
  - Pattern design
  - Computational geometry

## Usage

1. Open the `.toe` file in TouchDesigner
2. Define your input points
3. The Voronoi diagram will generate automatically
4. Adjust parameters to customize the output

## Applications

- **Game Development**: Procedural terrain and level generation
- **Design**: Creating organic patterns and textures
- **Analysis**: Spatial distribution and proximity studies
- **Art**: Generative visual compositions
