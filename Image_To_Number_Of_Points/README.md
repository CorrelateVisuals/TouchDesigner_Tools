# Image to Number of Points

![Image to Points Example](https://github.com/CorrelateVisuals/Touchdesigner_Tools/blob/main/Image_To_Number_Of_Points/Image_To_Number_Of_Points_Image.PNG?raw=true)

## Overview

Converts an input image to an equal number of points in 3D space. This tool is particularly useful for projects with a limited number of points, such as drone shows, LED installations, or other constraint-based visualizations.

## Features

- Convert any image to a specific number of 3D points
- Preserves visual structure with limited point budget
- Adjustable point distribution algorithms
- Real-time preview of point conversion

## Use Cases

- **Drone Shows**: Create formations with a fixed number of drones
- **LED Installations**: Map images to physical LED arrays
- **Point Cloud Art**: Generate artistic point-based representations
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduce complexity while maintaining visual fidelity

## How It Works

1. Load your input image
2. Specify the desired number of output points
3. The tool analyzes the image and distributes points to best represent the visual content
4. Export or use the resulting point cloud in your TouchDesigner project

## Parameters

- **Input Image**: Source image to convert
- **Number of Points**: Target point count
- **Distribution Method**: Algorithm for point placement
- **3D Depth**: Control Z-axis positioning based on image properties
