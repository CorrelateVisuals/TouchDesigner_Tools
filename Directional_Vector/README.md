# Directional Vector

![Directional Vector Example](https://github.com/CorrelateVisuals/TouchDesigner_Tools/blob/main/Directional_Vector/Directional_Vector_Image.PNG?raw=true)

## Overview

A directional vector, also known as a unit vector, represents both a direction and magnitude in 3D space. It is commonly used to describe rotations and orientations in computer graphics, robotics, and other fields involving three-dimensional transformations.

**Current Status**: Currently working in two dimensions, with 3D support planned for future updates.

## Features

- Visualize directional vectors in real-time
- Calculate and display vector magnitude and direction
- Interactive controls for vector manipulation
- Useful for understanding spatial relationships

## Applications

- **Computer Graphics**: Lighting calculations, surface normals, camera directions
- **Animation**: Motion paths and velocity vectors
- **Physics Simulations**: Force and velocity representations
- **Robotics**: Movement direction and orientation

## Technical Details

Directional vectors are normalized to unit length (magnitude = 1), making them ideal for representing pure direction without scale. This tool helps visualize and manipulate these vectors within TouchDesigner's 3D environment.

## Usage

1. Open the `.toe` file in TouchDesigner
2. Adjust the directional vector parameters
3. Observe real-time visualization of direction and magnitude
4. Use the output in your own TouchDesigner projects

## Future Development

- Full 3D support (currently 2D)
- Additional vector operations (cross product, dot product)
- Vector field visualization
