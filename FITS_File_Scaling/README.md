# FITS File Scaling

![alt text](https://github.com/CorrelateVisuals/Touchdesigner_Tools/blob/main/FITS_File_Scaling/FITS_File_Scaling_Image.PNG?raw=true)

A ![FITS](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_standard.html) (Flexible Image Transport System) file is a standard format used in astronomy for storing images, tables, and other data. It is designed to be platform-independent and widely supported by astronomical software for data analysis and sharing.

Image used for this example
```
FILE-NAME    'FINAL_EMIR_STR_IMG_H.fits'
INSTRUMENT   'EMIR    '               / EMIR
DATE-OBS     '2017-08-13T22:38:38.81' / Date of observation (start) in Y2K complian
UTC          '22:38:38.814872'        / Coordinate UT of the observation (start)
```
Astronomical data stored in FITS format can be attained at ![GRANTECAN's database](http://www.gtc.iac.es/). For more information visit ![GRANTECAN](http://www.gtc.iac.es/).

Special thanks to ![Derrivative](derivative.ca/) for implementing this widely adopted format into TouchdDesigner and assisting with the mathematical calculations.
