# Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram

![Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram Output](https://github.com/CorrelateVisuals/Touchdesigner_Tools/blob/main/Hertzsprung-Russell_Diagram/Hertzsprung-Russell_Diagram_Image.PNG?raw=true)

## Overview

The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram is a graphical representation that plots the luminosity (brightness) of stars against their surface temperature. It helps astronomers classify and study stars based on their evolutionary stage and characteristics.

This TouchDesigner tool analyzes astronomical imagery to generate H-R diagrams, useful for stellar classification and educational visualization.

## Features

- Process astronomical imagery to extract stellar data
- Generate Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams in real-time
- Visualize star classification and evolutionary stages
- Interactive parameter controls

## Example Image

The above output was generated using the following astronomical image:

## Technical Background

The H-R diagram is one of the most important tools in stellar astronomy. It reveals:
- Main sequence stars
- Giants and supergiants
- White dwarfs
- Stellar evolution patterns
- Star cluster age and composition
