In TouchDesigner, the SOP data type represents a surface geometry. Transforming a SOP data type to the EXR file format involves exporting the point cloud data as an OpenEXR file, which stores 3D point positions, colors, and other attributes, suitable for high dynamic range (HDR) rendering and post-processing workflows.
